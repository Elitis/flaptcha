Flaptcha is a AS3 implementation of reCAPTCHA's API. It also includes FlaptchaBox a Flex's (Spark) skinnable component.



Flaptcha can work directly with google's recaptcha in a AIR application but for a web flash because of security policies (crossdomain) it will need a web server with the flaptcha's php proxy installed. (Available in downloads).
